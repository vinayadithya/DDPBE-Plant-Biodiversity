        <h2>Eastern Ghats</h2>
        <p>The Eastern Ghats are a series of hill ranges located on the eastern side of the Deccan Plateau. They form a discontinuous mountain chain stretching from Odisha in the north, through Andhra Pradesh, and into Tamil Nadu in the south, with portions extending into Karnataka. These hills are intersected by four major rivers of southern India: the Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri. Like the Western Ghats, the Eastern Ghats have various local names, such as the Velikonda range in Andhra Pradesh and the Kollimalai and Shevaroy hills in Tamil Nadu.</p>
        <p>In Tamil Nadu, north of the Kaveri River, the higher mountain ranges of the Eastern Ghats include Kollimalai, Shevaroy, Kalrayan, Chitteri, Palamalai, and Mettur hills. These elevated regions experience a cooler and wetter climate. The Biligiri Hills extend eastward from the Western Ghats to the Kaveri River, forming a crucial forest corridor that links the Eastern and Western Ghats.</p>
        <p>The Eastern Ghats fall under a tropical monsoon climate, receiving rainfall from both the southwest and northeast monsoons. The region is rich in floristic diversity, with vegetation varying according to altitude, displaying distinct forest zonation. The primary forest types include scrub jungles, deciduous forests, evergreen forests, and sholas. The region supports over 2,500 species of angiosperms, accounting for approximately 13% of India's flowering plants.</p>
        <p>Several botanical studies have documented the region’s flora. Ellis (1987–90) conducted extensive plant collections in the Nallamalais, identifying 843 species across 419 genera and 109 families. Ranjitakaani (1998) recorded 854 angiosperm species, 57 pteridophytes, and 5 gymnosperms in the Kolli Hills of Salem district. Senthil Kumar and Krishnamurthy (1993) documented 1,184 flowering plant species in the Shevaroy Hills, spanning 674 genera and 150 families. Professor T. Pullaiah and his team from Sri Krishnadevaraya University reported 328 species of legumes (Pullaiah & Sriramamurthy, 2001), along with 69 species of Convolvulaceae, 14 of Boraginaceae, 16 of Cordiaceae, and 34 of Solanaceae (Venkatappa et al., 1998; Venkatappa, 1998). Additionally, Saxena and Brahmam (1994) detailed the flora of Odisha, Pullaiah et al. (1997) provided an account of Andhra Pradesh’s flora, and Nair and Henry (1983) documented the flora of Tamil Nadu. Together, these studies cover much of the Eastern Ghats' botanical diversity.</p>
